# HW-3-CSS_Cascade
CSS Cascade, Selection &amp; Pseudo Selectors

# Assignment Requirements :
1. Add a background image of some kind to the page - theme it however you like, but it should have something to do with a “to-do” list 
2. Add a header to the page and use an H1 tag (and others, if you like) to give your page a creative title. Use an ID attribute and CSS selector to style the header and its content.
3. Use generic element selectors, IDs and classes where appropriate and make the build your own - change colors, fonts, etc. Feel free to explore Google Fonts as a solution.
4. Add an input element with a type of checkbox to each “in progress” and each “done” list item in the “in progress” and “done” lists.
5. When you check an “in progress” list item, use the appropriate selector to also/additionally select the entire list item’s content and set their colour appropriately.
6. When you check a “done” item, use the appropriate selector to also /additionally select the entire list item’s content and set their colour appropriately.
7. Use the ::after pseudo selector to add a graphic element indicating completion (check, thumbs up, etc)
